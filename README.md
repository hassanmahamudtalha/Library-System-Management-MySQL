# üìö Library Management System ‚Äì MySQL Project

This project demonstrates the database schema for a **Library Management System**, including table creation, relationships, and initial structure for managing members, books, employees, issues, returns, and branches.

---

## üèóÔ∏è Database Schema

### ‚úÖ Create Database
```sql
CREATE DATABASE Library_System;
USE Library_System;
```

---

## üìã Table Structures

### üë§ Members Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Members (
    member_id VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    member_name VARCHAR(250),
    member_address VARCHAR(250),
    reg_date VARCHAR(255)
);
```

---

### üìö Books Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Books (
    isbn VARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    book_title VARCHAR(255),
    category VARCHAR(255),
    rental_price DECIMAL(6,2),
    `status` VARCHAR(255),
    author VARCHAR(255),
    publisher VARCHAR(255)
);
```

---

### üîÅ Return Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE return_status (
    return_id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
    issued_id VARCHAR(20),
    return_date VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Renaming the table
RENAME TABLE return_status TO `return`;

-- Removing unnecessary columns
ALTER TABLE `return` 
DROP COLUMN return_book_name,
DROP COLUMN return_book_isbn;
```

---

### üè¢ Branch Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Branch (
    branch_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    manager_id VARCHAR(50),
    branch_address VARCHAR(255),
    contact_no INT
);

-- Changing column name and type
ALTER TABLE Branch 
CHANGE COLUMN contact_no contact_on VARCHAR(50);
```

---

### üë®‚Äçüíº Employee Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employe (
    emp_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    emp_name VARCHAR(100),
    `position` VARCHAR(100),
    salary INT,
    branch_id VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

### üìñ Issue Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE issue (
    issued_id VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    issued_member_id VARCHAR(50),
    issued_book_name VARCHAR(100),
    issued_date VARCHAR(50),
    issued_book_isbn VARCHAR(100),
    issued_emp_id VARCHAR(50)
);
```

---

## ‚úÖ Notes

- All primary keys are defined to ensure uniqueness.
- Foreign key constraints can be added depending on further normalization and relational requirements.
- All date fields are stored as `VARCHAR` for simplicity, but can be converted to `DATE` type for stricter date handling.
- You can add sample data or additional constraints (e.g., `FOREIGN KEY`) as needed for your application logic.
